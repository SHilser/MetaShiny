# MetaShiny
Shiny App for conducting a systematic literature review.

This App has been inspired by the metagear package and aims to create an app that will help scientists and researchers to conduct systematic literature reviews in a simple way that doesn't require any coding skills, but at the same time giving them the power that R provides.
